## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I generally write and test my code at the same time. As I add new classes and functions, once the code is in a state where it can be executed, I will test its functionality to make sure it is behaving the way I want it to. I also incorporate more thorough tests into my development process as blocks of code start to form components of a larger system. At this point, individual functions will have undergone several tests and I will begin to test the behaviors of the system to be sure that it works and behaves the way a user would expect.

To help ensure security, I make it a point to test all functions with improper inputs to be sure that errors are caught and properly dealt with. I want to be sure that when something is wrong, the program stops (and recovers if possible) rather than continuing to execute in a compromised state.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I try to break down users' needs into a tree of more and more detailed requirements and create a diagram or rough pseudo code to work with. For example, if a user needs a program to print a report, I can break this down into smaller parts.
A) The program needs to read information X
B) The program needs to calculate A+B*C
C) The output needs to be formatted correctly
etc...

Then, where possible, I'll break each of those concepts down into more details and so on. This helps me generate a map of what I need to do with my code to get the end results the user will be looking for.

## How do I approach designing software?
I try to make sure that my code is functional, secure, and easy to read. I write everything with the mindset that at some point someone else will need to read or modify my work. That someone might even be myself, months or years later when I've long forgotten what I wrote. I want to make everything easy for everyone, from colleagues to end users. The code should be designed and written with other developers in mind while the final product should be designed to exceed the expectations of the target user(s). In the middle, everything should be tested and retested to be sure that requirements are met and security is maintained.
